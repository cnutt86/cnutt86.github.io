In this post, I present a mini-project employing NumPy to calculate planet volumes. There are two primary goals associated with this project. These goals include the following: 1) Calculate volumes for the planets in our solar system and 2) Calculate volumes for 1 million fictitious planets with randomly generated radii.

When carried out, this script demonstrates the speed and efficiency with which NumPy makes calculations.

Below pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported to access functions from those sources that will be used in the program

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
